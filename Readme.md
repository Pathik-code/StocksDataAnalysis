1. Purpose and Objectives

Core Problem Solved
1. Market Volatility: Traders and analysts require instant updates to make informed decisions due to rapid fluctuations in stock prices.
2. Delayed Insights: Existing systems might lack real-time capabilities, leading to missed opportunities.
3. High-Volume Data: Handling large volumes of stock tick data requires a robust, scalable solution.

Measurable Goals
1. Real-Time Processing: Achieve sub-second latency for ingesting, processing, and displaying stock data.
2. Actionable Insights: Provide alerts for significant market changes, e.g., price surges, dips, or threshold breaches.
3. Data Availability: Maintain system uptime of 99.9%, ensuring high reliability and availability.
4. Accuracy: Guarantee data consistency across ingestion, processing, and visualization layers.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. Key Processes

Workflows
1. Data Ingestion
  Source: Stock exchange APIs, broker feeds, or market vendors.
  Tools: Apache Kafka streams stock prices, orders, and trade volumes into the system.
2. Real-Time Processing
  Operations:
    Filtering: Exclude outliers or invalid records.
    Aggregations: Calculate metrics like moving averages, trade volumes, and volatility.
    Enrichment: Add metadata like sector, company name, or market cap for better context.
  Tools: Apache Flink or Spark Streaming applies transformation logic.
3. Storage
  Processed data stored in PostgreSQL for structured queries and Elasticsearch for full-text search and analytics.
4. Visualization
  Grafana dashboards provide:
    Real-time stock price movements.
    Alerts for predefined triggers (e.g., 10% intraday changes).

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. Checks and Validations

1. Data Accuracy
  Validate stock symbols and prices against known ranges.
  Cross-check with redundant data sources to prevent inaccuracies.
2. Consistency
  Ensure timestamps are in sync across all data points.
  Deduplicate records to avoid redundant processing.
3. Reliability
  Set up fallback mechanisms if the primary data source fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. Logic and Conditions

Rules and Algorithms
1. Thresholds
  Example: Trigger an alert if stock price changes by more than 5% within 1 minute.
2. Anomaly Detection
  Use machine learning models or statistical methods to detect unusual trading patterns.
  Example: If trading volume for a stock exceeds its 3-month average by 3x, flag it.
3. Moving Average Calculations
  50-day, 200-day moving averages to indicate long-term trends.
4. Conditional Filters
  Include stocks from specific sectors (e.g., tech or finance) based on user preferences.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Metrics for Success

1. Latency: Processing time <1 second from data ingestion to visualization.
2. Accuracy: 99.99% accuracy in reflecting real-time stock prices.
3. Uptime: Maintain 99.9% availability.
4. User Engagement: Daily active users of the dashboard and number of alerts acted upon.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. Scenarios and Use Cases

Scenario 1: Price Surge Alert
  Input: Stock price increases by 10% in 2 minutes.
  Output: Real-time alert sent to traders, updated dashboard visualization.

Scenario 2: Anomaly Detection

  Input: Trade volume for Stock A is 5x its normal range.
  Output: Dashboard highlights the stock, alerting analysts for further investigation.

Scenario 3: Portfolio Monitoring

  Input: User-specific portfolio with selected stocks.
  Output: Custom dashboards display portfolio performance and alerts for personalized thresholds.

----------------------------------------------------------------

7. Feedback and Iteration

1. Handling New Data
  Add new stock exchanges or symbols dynamically to the pipeline without downtime.
2. Error Management
  Log and retry failed records during ingestion or processing.
  Provide a feedback mechanism to identify and rectify inconsistencies.
3. Anomaly Feedback
  Use flagged anomalies as training data to refine detection models over time.

----------------------------------------------------------------

8. Schema and Formulation Details

Schema Design
1. Raw Data Table
  stock_symbol (VARCHAR): Unique ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
  price (FLOAT): Current trading price.
  volume (BIGINT): Number of shares traded.
  timestamp (TIMESTAMP): Record timestamp.
2. Processed Data Table
  symbol (VARCHAR): Stock ticker.
  moving_avg_50d (FLOAT): 50-day moving average.
  moving_avg_200d (FLOAT): 200-day moving average.
  volatility (FLOAT): Price volatility score.
  anomaly_flag (BOOLEAN): Whether this record triggered an anomaly.
3. Alert Table
  alert_id (UUID): Unique alert identifier.
  trigger_condition (VARCHAR): Description of the rule triggered.
  alert_time (TIMESTAMP): Time the alert was generated.

Formulas

1. Moving Average
2. MAn=Sum of prices over n daysnMA_n = \frac{\text{Sum of prices over } n \text{ days}}{n}MAn​=nSum of prices over n days​
3. Volatility
4. Volatility=∑i=1n(Pi−Avg Price)2n\text{Volatility} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(P_i - \text{Avg Price})^2}{n}}Volatility=n∑i=1n​(Pi​−Avg Price)2​​
5. where PiP_iPi​ = price at time iii.
